I am water, fluid, shifting and never static.
I am part of a stream, flowing with others.
Within them a mixture of me made by exchange from mingling together.
All of us in an vast ocean greater than any horizon can capture.
To always be flowing, never frozen, never captured.
Gazed upon but never truly seen, never truly grasped.
I help carry the ships and cargo above, never observed as me but always as us.
Soon I will descend, forgotten to all but by that which lives in the great abyss below.
Can I ever be seen? Can I ever stop? Will I ever see the cargo reach its port?
Or am I doomed to only be in a puddle of this sea, only a glimpse of the vast before my time comes?
All the same I greet the current, following each ebb and flow, interacting and changing the whole.
